Better workflow for doing Calculords:

Node server

Start turn
 - Take screenshot
 - Deliver screenshot to frontend
 - Manually input numbers
 - Click "Calculate"
  - Calculation runs
  - send message w/ numbers to backend
  - Backend saves picture id + numbers to DB
 - User chooses best option
 - User pushes "next turn" button
  - Triggers screenshot
 - repeat

Frontend:
More deliberate next turn button
Tracking of what phase of turn (?)

NN:
Get MNIST data up and running with Synaptic




Start turn:
 - take screenshot & send
 - User inputs #'s
 - JS calc math on frontend
 - send to backend, which pushes buttons
 - When all buttons pushed, take new screenshot, send to frontend


NO NEED FOR SOLUTION PICK ON FRONTEND (for now)

Frontend states:
 - start button
 - input from screenshot
 - Calc'ing
 - Waiting for backend
